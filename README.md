# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Project Goal
To analyze the demographics of bike buyers and understand which factors (income, commute distance, age) influence a purchase.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates and standardized the "Marital Status" and "Gender" columns.
2. **Analysis:** Created pivot tables to compare Average Income vs. Purchase.
3. **Dashboard:** Built an interactive dashboard with slicers.
